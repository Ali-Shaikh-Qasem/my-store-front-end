# MyStore

MyStore is an e-commerce Angular application that allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete the checkout process. The application features a product listing page, product detail pages, a shopping cart, and a checkout confirmation flow.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.4.


## Features

- Product listing with images, names, and prices
- Product detail pages with quantity selection

- Checkout process with form validation
- Order confirmation page

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd my-store
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Launch Instructions

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
